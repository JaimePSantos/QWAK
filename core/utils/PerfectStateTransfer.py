    then its degree k will be crucial.
    First, we check for integer roots in the interval [-n^4,n^4] that the eigenvalues should be. We check by putting the
    value in the loop, i, direct into h(i) and we see if it is equal to zero. If it is, then we check if i is in the
    eigenvalue support of a. With both conditions satisfied, it stores 1 to delta and sum one to intRoots.
    Then we check if all roots are quadratic integers p+qr*Sqrt(delta)/2. We know that p will be equal to the coefficient
    of the second bigest power of h(x). Then, all we need to do is loop through the values of delta in the list of square-free
    integers. Then, we loop qr until it is bigger than Sqrt(Tr(AÂ²)) and check if is a root of h(x) and it is also in the
    eigenvalue support of a. In case it is true, we store the value of delta and sum one to quadRoots.
    Here we check if quadRoots or intRoots are bigger than k, which is the degree of our polynomial h(x). If none of them is
    then we know that PST is not possible and we return False.
    The time that PST occurs is just pi/g*Sqrt(delta) where g = gcd(theta0 - thetar), i.e. the gcd between all the differences
    of the eigenvalue theta0 (the biggest eigenvalue) and all others eigenvalues.
