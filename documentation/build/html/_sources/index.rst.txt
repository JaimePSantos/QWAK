QWAK - Quantum Walk Analysis Kit
=================================

:py:class:`.QWAK` is an object-oriented Python package for the realization of
continuous-time quantum walks. With this package you have the ability to perform both
unitary pure quantum walks, as well as introduce classical effects with the :py:class:`.StochasticQWAK`
quantum walk.

Additionally, a graphical user interface is provided as a user
friendly alternative, where it is possible to study several different aspects of the quantum
walk without having prior coding knowledge. See the :doc:`installation <installation>` page for more information.
