Installation
============

QWAK is not yet hosted on PiPy, so you will need to install it locally preferably with a virtual environment.
You can find instructions for setting up the environment with conda :ref:`here <conda-installation>` and with venv :ref:`here <venv-installation>`.
You can also find all the dependencies :ref:`here <dependencies>`.
After you are done setting up your environment, and all the required dependencies are met (GPU users specifically) the package can be installed via PyPi:
.. code-block:: console

  pip install qwak-sim


Testing the installation
************************
The first step will be to clone the repository:

.. code-block:: console

  git clone https://github.com/JaimePSantos/QWAK.git

.. _testing-installation:

Testing the installation
************************

The basic testing script can be run by:

.. code-block:: console

    python installCheck.py

If no errors are thrown and you end up with some plots opened, then the installation was successful.

However, we recommend running the package's unit tests via pytest:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pytest
    pytest -v tests/
