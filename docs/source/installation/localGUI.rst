Running the Graphical Interface using Flask
===========================================

To run the graphical interface locally using Flask, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. Install MongoDB locally. Follow the instructions on the [MongoDB installation page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

3. Navigate to the `gui-flask` directory containing your Flask application.

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```
   python flaskqwak.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the graphical interface.

There are plans to re-implement QWAK using Eel and create an executable from that.
